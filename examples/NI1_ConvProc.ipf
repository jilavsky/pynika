//2.78 change some calculations to DP as 2024-09-26, some users are running with intensity out of SP precision.
//2.77 fix for behavior with UseSampleTransmission controls.
//2.76 Fix LUT type to 32bit unsigned integer. Wiht LUT wave as FP32 on 4kx4k images Nika was running out of p precision and data reduction broke.
//2.75 fix for TransformAxis1.2 Ticks change done at version 9.02
//2.74 ~2022 sometimes.
//			added ability to calculate transmission using semi transparent beamstop.
//			removed use of calibrated data, let's see if anyone complains. I do nto think there is any use for this.
//			add Transpose and flips for image after load.
//2.73 5-24-2021 changed resolution to be FWHM/2, same as USAXS and as expected by Modeling package and sasView.
//		modifed NI1A_CalculateQresolution to return FWHM and use only Q steps and Beam size. Pixel size used before is wrong, that is accounted for in Q stepping already, Nika cannot oversample in Q points.
//2.72 Remove for MatrixOP /NTHR=0 since it is applicable to 3D matrices only
//2.71 Added NI1A_ImportThisJPGFile which adds functionality ONLY for 9IDC USAXS/SAXS/WAXS instrument. Should never run else.
//2.70 fixed NI1A_FindeOrderNumber to utilize for sorting in "_001" option the last number, ignores any string, even if at the end of name.
//			can sort nases as "name_With_Order_0001344_waxs.tif" based on teh 0001344
//2.69 fixed NI1A_GenerAngleLine for angles between 135 - 360 deg. Allow negative angles, If Angle<0, Angle = 180+Angle
//2.68 Fixed to accept tiff as tif extension.
//2.67 Added Batch processing
//2.66 fixes for rtGlobal=3
//2.65 fixerd solid angle correction. It was doing the wrong thing.
//2.64 added new tab with Save data opions, seems better. Removed range selections. Added controls for delay between images and display ImageStatistics.
//2.63 fix bug when user did stuff our of order.
//2.62 fixed single precision rounding error (ki and kout were single precision) which caused under some cconditions problems with data at low-q bining.
//2.61 fixed erros for case where we have missing range of Q in the middle of detecotr (space between tiles on Pilatus).
//2.60 fixed case when for intensities=0 (set in software like Mar165) we wouldget error=0 and users would consider these regular data points. Removed now.
//2.59 tried to speed up the main conversion loop. Fixed case where for negative intensities we can get nan as uncertainty and for Int=0 uncertainty=0.
//2.58 added saving color table in preferences.
//2.57 removed unused functions
//2.56 added getHelp button calling to www manual
//2.55 fixed missing forced naming to data. Now will force use of File name fopr naming the data if nothign else is selected.
//2.54 added a lot of 	//IN2G_PrintDebugStatement(IrenaDebugLevel, 5,"") in the code here.
//2.53 important correction - prior versions did NOT have samplethickness converted to cm, so this may break prior exerimets calibrations.
//2.52 changed selection options for data
//2.51 New nexus support fixes. Pops up now the panel as needed and sets the input choice.
//2.50 Modified to point to USXS_data on USAXS computers, added handling of ...tiff file names
//2.49 added Function for creating user custom data names.
//2.48 added main data reduction parameters in the wave note. For unknown reason were missing.
//2.47 added time stamps to background task print statements so user has any idea when was the task run last time.
//2.46 added Q width (Q resolution, dQ) to line profiles. Works only for Q for now, fix for bug in Qresolution callcualtions in version 2.45
//2.45 added Qresolution accounting which takes care of bin width + pixel size + beam size
//2.44 fixed bug when 2DQwave had note appended, not repalced and if beam center changed, it will get recaculated always since a wrong center values were read first.
//2.43 added ability to type in Q distance from center for line profile. Is rounded to nearest full pixel.
//2.42 minor GISAXS panel update (kill it on tab change).
//2.41 GISAXS panel now updates lineprofile, when value changes.
//2.40 added GISAXS_SOL and GISAXS_LSS geomtries - vary for alfa-f per marvin infor from below. Uses new panel and variable.
//2.39 fixed GISAXS alfa-f calculation. Bug found by one of the users marvin.berlinghof@fau.de
//2.38 removed Executes as preparation for Igor 7
//2.37 renamed tab "Prev" into "PolTran" = Polar transform. This seems better descrition of the conversion.
//2.36 added ADSC_A
//2.35 moved Dezinger to tab 2 - some users thought, that dezingenring is available only for empty and dark.
//2.34 can read/write canSAS/Nexus files. Can log-bin 2D data and use those.
//2.33 fixed display of files for CanSAS/Nexus file type
//2.32 fixed case, when user wanted to display processed data, but the images were created/updated before the processed data were even created.
//2.31 added hook functions, required change in main panel function from macro to function and therefore also renaming it.
//2.30 Added right click "Refresh content" to Listbox and other functionality
//2.29 fixed /NTHR=1 to
//2.28 add ability to load and use 2D calibrated data (from EQSANS for now)
//2.27 adds DataCalibrationString to GUI and Intensity/q/theta/d/distance data
//2.26 added double clicks to Mask listbox and to Empty/Dark listboxes.
//2.25 adds TPA/XML code
//2.24 minor GUI improvements
//2.23 Refresh now sets top data set as selected. Added first version of background task monitoring folder...
//2.22 added user defined Image range and display color scale...
//2.21 added export in distacne from center, minor fix in search for match files
//2.20 changed behavior to enable calculation of smeared data in 9IDC SAXS instrument
//2.19 fixed NI1A_UpdateEmptyDarkListBox() for bug (was looking in wrong path...)
//2.18 fixed UpdateEmptyDark File list
//2.17 Support for SAXS and Nexus file reader, fixed loadEMpty/dark bug which used wrong extension for file
//2.16 found another bug in PixSensitivity correction, it was done twice under some conditions... , Chenged fixed offset to allow for negative values.
//2.15 added ability to check and skip for bad loaded files... Reflects changes to UniversalFileLoader
//2.14 Added Movie creating option, some code modification necessary. NOte: Main thing is that I had to move the order of 2Dto1Dconversion after displaying 2D images, not before.
//2.13 fixed bug in Corrections for 2D wave identified by user. The transmission correction was done befor esubtraction of the dark frame, which is wrong... 6/17/2011
//2.12 added azimuthal tilts on detector; removed filter for extension for MarIP files (requested, what a mess this will create :-(  )
// 2.11 (3/25/2011) modified to use tilt correction which was developed by Jon Tischler. Should be correct now and quick. Note: geometrical corrections are still
// valid for no tilts only and for now assume tilt around Z axis (beam direction) to be 0 - therefore x axis on detector must be horizontal.
//2.10 modifies BSL loader as requested by JOSH
//2.09 added mutlithread and MatrixOp/NTHR=1 where seemed possible to use multile cores
//2.08 fix change in TransformAxis with Igor 6.21 which requires one more parameter. Set to useScientific=1., made compatible to prior version of Igor 6 also.
//2.07 added license for ANL

//2.03 2/22/2010 added ability to display the Q axes on the image
//2.02 Pilatus stuff
// 2.01 12/06/2009... Changed error calculations to multiple choice. Version 1.43.
//2.00  10/25/2009... Many changes related to line profile tools and some minor fixes. JIL.
//1.11 9/3/09 fixed I0Monitor count showing up at wrong time, JIL.
// 1.1 updated 8/31 to address Polarization correction, JIL
//1.01 changed ADSC type to only display .img files.

//Tilt comments:
//as best as I can, these are the assumptions...
// first rotate detector around vector R={xrot,yrot,zrot}.
// then move detector from sample position, detector xcentered on the sample and beam by vector P={x,y,z}, where z is basically sample-detector distance.
// x, z are shifts from centered position on tetector, so x and y are basically beam center positions
// Here is original John's description... but note that I have changed the order and tilt the detector first to make this more suitabel for our usual definitions...
// Position of detector: first translate by P, and then rotate detector around R.  Since rho is rotation matrix calculated from R:
//		{X,Y,Z} = rho x [P+{x',y',z'}] ,   where XYZ are beam line coords, and {x'y'z'} are coordinates in detector reference frame.
// Size of detector is measured to the outer edge of the outer most pixels.  So conversion from position to pixel for the x direction is:
//		x' = ( pixel - (Nx-1)/2 )*pitch,   where sizeX = Nx*pitch.  This puts the coordinate of pixel (i,j) at the center of the pixel.
